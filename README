Racket Extended Code Coverage

This tool adds another button to DrRacket labeled "Load Code Coverage." Clicking this button will bring up a dialog that displays all files evaluated by running the program that is currently in focus. Files that contain uncovered lines appear at the top of this list. Selecting one of the files and pressing "Open" will either switch to a frame containing that file, or open a new frame with that file. Additionally, all open frames that contain files covered by the original program will have code coverage highlighting applied to them.
