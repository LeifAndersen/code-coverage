DrRacket, the integrated development environment for Racket, includes basic code coverage limited to a single file. The main goal of this senior project was to extend DrRacket's code coverage to multiple files. Two additional goals were also included: provide concrete information on the amount of covered code versus uncovered, and implementing the extension with minimal modification to DrRacket's source code. To fulfill these goals the Multi-file Code Coverage Tool was created after first researching DrRacket's code coverage implementation and user interface. The Multi-file Code Coverage Tool is written as a PLaneT package which extends DrRacket without requiring any modifications to DrRacket's source code. The tool adds a new button to DrRacket and new dialogs that display code coverage information.
