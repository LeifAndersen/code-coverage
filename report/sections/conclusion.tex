The main goal of this senior project, extending DrRacket's code coverage to multiple files, was successfully implemented. The two additional goals, providing concrete code coverage information and requiring minimal or no DrRacket source modification, were also completed. Concrete code coverage information was provided through a series of additional dialogs. Since the Multi-file Code Coverage Tool was implemented as a PLaneT package no modifications to DrRacket's source were required. An additional feature of saving code coverage information was also implemented. While there is certainly areas where the Multi-file Code Coverage Tool could be improved, doing so would require an even greater understanding of the underpinnings of DrRacket.
